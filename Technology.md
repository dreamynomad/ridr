ridr detects the pulse data, musle tensions, micro sweating, and mechanical motion reflexes while driving a cycle/motorcycle/car. 

It helps the user to feel the vibrations from the wearable, if he is speeding up, driving rashly or feeling tensed about time etc.

The haptic feedback helps the rider in realtime to reduce the chances of accidents and leads to a safe driving behaviour.
